# Purpose
Note for myself, to learn or recap scala quickly

# Way I did
Since scala is FP language, to understand it quickly and write properly code, we need learn some concepts about it like: 
* Monoid
* Applicative
* Functor
* Monad

The best article to understand them quickly is [here](https://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)

All of scala's developers have to learned about type cats, so let do all exercise at below links (should before start coding
on any project)

# Things keep in mind
There are only 2 important things in FP: 
* Data model 
* Function 

When write function always think about immutable and side effect (in community it is called `effect`). 

# Best of scala
For myself, there are some scala's components I'd love to work with: 
* Either
* Future
* For comprehension
* Case class 
* Case object

# Libraries should learn
* cats
* zio
